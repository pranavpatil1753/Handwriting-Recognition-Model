# Handwriting-Recognition-Model
This model can predict the digits based on human handwriting data provided with having accuracy of 99.21%

The Handwritten Digit Recognition System is designed to accurately classify images of handwritten digits using deep learning techniques. Utilizing the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, the system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process and classify each digit. By employing preprocessing techniques such as normalization and data augmentation, the model is trained to recognize digits with high accuracy. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers with softmax activation for classification. The model is trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized with the Adam optimizer. After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, where metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices are used to assess its performance across different digit classes. The system can be integrated into a web or mobile application, allowing users to draw digits and receive real-time predictions. This project demonstrates proficiency in machine learning and deep learning techniques, specifically in computer vision tasks.
